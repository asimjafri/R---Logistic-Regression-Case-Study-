# R---Logistic-Regression-Case-Study-
Business Case Overview: 
This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting customer churn at “Cell2Cell,” a 
fictitious wireless telecom company, and use insights from the model to develop an incentive plan 
for enticing would-be churners to remain with Cell2Cell. 
Data for the case are available in csv format. The data are a scaled down version of the full database 
generously donated by an anonymous wireless telephone company. There are still 71,047 customers 
in the database, and 75 potential predictors. Trainees can use whatever method they wish to develop 
their predictive model. Logistic regression is perhaps the most obvious choice and is adequate for the 
task. 
The data are available in one data file with 71,047 rows that combines the calibration and validation 
customers. “calibration” database consisting of 40,000 customers and a “validation” database 
consisting of 31,047 customers. Each database contained (1) a “churn” variable signifying whether 
the customer had left the company two months after observation, and (2) a set of 75 potential 
predictor variables that could be used in a predictive churn model. Following usual model
development procedures, the model would be estimated on the calibration data and tested on the 
validation data. At the time, Cell2Cell’s churn rate was about 2% per month. However, data set has 
been created the calibration database so that it contained roughly 50% churners. The validation data 
contained 2% churners. 
This case requires both statistical analysis and creativity/judgment. I recommend you not spend too 
much time on fine-tuning your predictive model; make sure you spend sufficient time interpreting 
results. 
Expectations from the Trainees: 
Your task is to execute the 3-stage process for proactive churn management. Please answer the 
following questions: 
1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinierity. Describe your predictive 
churn model. How did you select variables to be included in the model? 
2. Demonstrate the predictive performance of the model. 
3. What are the key factors that predict customer churn? Do these factors make sense? 
4. What offers should be made to which customers to encourage them to remain with Cell2Cell? 
Assume that your objective is to generate net positive cash flow, i.e., generate additional 
customer revenues after subtracting out the cost of the incentive. 
5. Assuming these actions were implemented, how would you determine whether they had 
worked?
